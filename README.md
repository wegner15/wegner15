Hi there, I'm Nashon @wegner15, a self-taught programmer and software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I first fell in love with coding when I was tinkering around with my first computer and teaching myself the basics of programming.

These days, I work on a range of projects, from developing cutting-edge web applications to building enterprise software and bots. I'm always exploring new technologies and pushing myself to learn new skills.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on the road â€“ I'm an avid biker and hiker, and I love nothing more than exploring new trails and seeing new sights. I'm also a bit of a nomad, and I've been known to pack up my laptop and hit the road for weeks at a time.

And when I need to cool off after a long day of programming, I love nothing more than diving into the nearest swimming hole. There's something about the rush of the water that clears my mind and helps me focus on the next big project.

So whether I'm typing away at my keyboard or exploring the great outdoors, one thing is for sure â€“ I'm always looking for the next big challenge. If you're looking for a programmer who's passionate, creative, and always up for something new, I'm your person.
